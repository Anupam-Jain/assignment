        <h3> Bill Gates</h3>
    </center>
    <p class="bill-content">
        William Henry Gates III (born October 28, 1955) is an American business magnate, investor, author,
        philanthropist, and humanitarian. He is best known as the principal founder of Microsoft Corporation.
        During his career at Microsoft, Gates held the positions of chairman, CEO and chief software architect, while
        also being the largest individual shareholder until May 2014.
        In 1975, Gates and Paul Allen launched Microsoft, which became the world's largest PC software company. Gates
        led the company as chairman and CEO until stepping down as CEO in January 2000, but he remained chairman and
        became chief software architect.
        In June 2006, Gates announced that he would be transitioning to a part-time role at Microsoft and full-time work
        at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the private charitable foundation that he and his wife, Melinda Gates,
        established in 2000.

    <p class="bill-content">
        He gradually transferred his duties to Ray Ozzie and Craig Mundie.
        He stepped down as chairman of Microsoft in February 2014 and assumed a new post as technology adviser to
        support the newly appointed CEO Satya Nadella.[10]
        Gates is one of the best-known entrepreneurs of the personal computer revolution. He has been criticized for his
        business tactics, which have been considered anti-competitive. This opinion has been upheld by numerous court
        rulings. </p>
