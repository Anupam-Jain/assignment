        His father, Jean Leon Arnault, a graduate of École Centrale Paris, was a manufacturer and the owner of the civil

        Boussac owned Christian Dior, the department store Le Bon Marché, the retail shop Conforama, and the diapers
        manufacturer Peaudouce.
        He sold nearly all the company's assets, keeping only the prestigious Christian Dior brand and Le Bon Marché
        department store.
