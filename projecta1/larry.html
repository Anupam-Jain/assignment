    <p class="larry-content">
        Lawrence Joseph "Larry" Ellison (born August 17, 1944) is an American businessman, entrepreneur, and
        philanthropist who is a co-founder and the executive chairman and chief technology officer (CTO) of Oracle
        Corporation.
        As of March 2019, he was listed by Forbes magazine as the fourth-wealthiest person in the United States, and as
        the seventh-wealthiest in the world, with a fortune of $66.1 billion, increased from $54.5 billion in 2018.

    <p class="larry-content">
        Larry Ellison was born in New York City, to an unwed Jewish mother.His biological father was an Italian American
        United States Army Air Corps pilot. After Ellison contracted pneumonia at the age of nine months, his mother
        gave him to her aunt and uncle for adoption.
        He did not meet his biological mother again until he was 48. Ellison moved to Chicago's South Shore, then a
        middle-class neighborhood. He remembers his adoptive mother as warm and loving, in contrast to his austere,
        unsupportive, and often distant adoptive father, who had adopted the name Ellison to honor his point of entry
        into the United States, Ellis Island.
        Louis Ellison was a government employee who had made a small fortune in Chicago real estate, only to lose it
        during the Great Depression.
        Although Ellison was raised in a Reform Jewish home by his adoptive parents, who attended synagogue regularly,
        he remained a religious skeptic. Ellison states: "While I think I am religious in one sense, the particular
        dogmas of Judaism are not dogmas I subscribe to. I don't believe that they are real. They're interesting
        stories.
        They're interesting mythology, and I certainly respect people who believe these are literally true, but I don't.
        I see no evidence for this stuff." At age thirteen, Ellison refused to have a bar mitzvah celebration.
        Ellison says that his love affair with Israel is not connected to religious sentiments, but rather due to the
        innovative spirit of Israelis in the technology sector.
        Ellison studied at the University of Illinois at Urbanaâ€“Champaign, withdrawing after his second year, without
        taking final exams, because his adoptive mother had just died. After spending the summer of 1966 in California,
        he then attended the University of Chicago for one term, where he first encountered computer design.
        In 1966, aged 22, he moved to Berkeley California.
