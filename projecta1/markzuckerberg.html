        <h3> Mark Zuckerberg</h3>
    </center>
    <p class="mark-content">
        Mark Elliot Zuckerberg (born May 14, 1984) is an American technology entrepreneur and philanthropist. Zuckerberg
        is known for co-founding and leading Facebook as its chairman and chief executive officer.
        He also co-founded and is a board member of the solar sail spacecraft development project Breakthrough Starshot.
        Born in White Plains, New York, Zuckerberg attended Harvard University, where he launched Facebook from his
        dormitory room on February 4, 2004, with college roommates Eduardo Saverin, Andrew McCollum, Dustin Moskovitz,
        and Chris Hughes.
        Originally launched to select college campuses, the site expanded rapidly and eventually beyond colleges,
        reaching one billion users by 2012. Zuckerberg took the company public in May 2012 with majority shares. His net
        worth is estimated to be $55.0 billion as of November 30, 2018, declining over the last year with Facebook stock
        as a whole.
        In 2007 at age 23 he became the world's youngest self-made billionaire.
        As of 2018, he is the only person under 50 in the Forbes ten richest people list, and the only one under 40 in
        the Top 20 Billionaires list.
