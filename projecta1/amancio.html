        <h3> Amancio Ortega</h3>
    </center>
    <p class="amancio-content">
        Amancio Ortega Gaona (born 28 March 1936) is a Spanish billionaire businessman. He is the founder and former
        chairman of Inditex fashion group, best known for its chain of Zara clothing and accessories shops.
        As of late September 2018, Ortega had a net worth of $70 billion, making him the second-wealthiest person in
        Europe after Bernard Arnault, and the sixth-wealthiest in the world. He is the head of the Ortega family.
        Ortega is also the wealthiest retailer in the world.
    </p>
    <p class="amancio-content">
        The youngest of four children, Ortega was born in Busdongo de Arbás, León, Spain, to Antonio Ortega Rodríguez
        and Josefa Gaona Hernández from the province of Valladolid, and spent his childhood in León.
        He left school and moved to A Coruña at the age of 14, due to the job of his father, a railway worker.
        Shortly after, he found a job as a shop hand for a local shirtmaker called Gala, which still sits on the same
        corner in downtown A Coruña, and learned to make clothes by hand.
